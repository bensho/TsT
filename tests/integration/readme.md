# Integration tests on a semi-real example

This folder is an integration end-to-end test that runs the console NodeJS-based compiler on a set of input files extracted
from a real application that actually uses erecruit.TsT and works quite well.
This section (its input files) will be updated as we find (and fix) issues during our normal work process.
